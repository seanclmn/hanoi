# Tower of Hanoi

## Introduction

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle invented French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883. 

Move the entire stack to the far right rod, whilst obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from any rod and placing it on top of another stack or an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Technologies Used

I used Javascript, html, and css to program the game. For sound design, I used free sounds from the internet and sound processing via Ableton Live. 

## Gameplay

Gameplay involves dragging the the disks with the mouse. Physical constraints and rules are implemented in the code, so no illegal moves are possible.

There is a restart button which restarts the game and replaces the disks to the original configuration. There is also a rules button on every page that displays a modal with the rules of the game. There is also a move counter which counts the number of complete moves made.

The targeted user is someone who is looking to solve interesting mathematical puzzles, and has an appreciation for minimalist design. The following is a screenshot from the game.

## WireFrame

This is the original wireframe. I initially wanted to create a timer, but instead I decided to have a move counter instead. I also initially wanted a scoreboard, but I thought that the UI would look to cluttered so I left it out of the final product.
